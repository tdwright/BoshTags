Boshtags
===
Hashtags are weak. Boshtags are strong.

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then [boshtags.user.js](https://raw.github.com/tdwright/BoshTags/master/boshtags.user.js), then bosh.

BoshKeys
---
I've also written an AutoHotKey HotString. This makes it really quick to bosh things.
* The simplest way to get it is to [download my executable](http://tdwright.co.uk/boshkeys.exe).
* Or, if you have AHK_L installed you can find [the script](https://raw.github.com/tdwright/BoshTags/master/boshkeys.ahk) in this repo. (It has to be [AHK_L](http://l.autohotkey.net/) because the boshmark is a unicode symbol.)
Once you've got it running, just type !b to insert a boshmark.
